# 🚀 DEPLOY TO NETLIFY NOW

Your site is 100% ready for deployment! Here's how to deploy it:

---

## ⚡ FASTEST METHOD (Since you already connected Netlify)

### Option 1: Git Push (Auto-Deploy)
If your Netlify site is connected to a Git repository:

```bash
# In your local terminal (not here), run:
git add .
git commit -m "Fixed deployment configuration"
git push
```

Netlify will automatically detect the push and redeploy within 30-60 seconds.

---

### Option 2: Netlify Dashboard (Manual Trigger)

1. **Go to**: https://app.netlify.com/sites
2. **Find your site**: Look for "marassi-logistics" or your site name
3. **Click on it** to open site settings
4. **Go to "Deploys" tab**
5. **Click**: "Trigger deploy" → "Deploy site"
6. **Wait**: 20-30 seconds for deployment to complete

---

### Option 3: Drag & Drop Deploy

1. **Go to**: https://app.netlify.com/drop
2. **Drag your entire project folder** into the browser
3. **Wait**: Site will be live in ~30 seconds
4. **Save the URL** Netlify gives you

Your site will be live at:
- **Your Netlify URL**: `https://your-site-name.netlify.app`
- Or your custom domain (if configured)

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Contact Form**: Currently not functional. After deployment, update contact.html:
   ```html
   <form netlify name="contact" method="POST">
   ```

2. **Local Development**: Still works with:
   ```bash
   npm start
   # Visit http://localhost:3000
   ```

3. **Future Deployments**: Just push to Git, Netlify auto-deploys

---

## 🆘 If You Get Errors

Check Netlify deploy logs:
1. Go to your site in Netlify dashboard
2. Click "Deploys"
3. Click on the failed deploy
4. Read the error log

Common issues:
- Build command failed → Check netlify.toml
- Files missing → Ensure all files committed to Git
- 404 errors → Check _redirects file
